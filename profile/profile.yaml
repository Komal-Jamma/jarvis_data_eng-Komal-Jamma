summary: I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Solapur University. I started off my career as a Web Designer at Gubbi Enterprises 6 years ago, where I worked with the development and testing team to meet the client requirements. I have always been interested in Business System Analyst roles because I enjoy meeting with users to define business needs and maintaining software systems. I am proficient in languages such as Python and SQL and tools such as SQL Server Management System, SQL databases and, Tableau. My goal is to work as a Business System Analyst. I believe I can be a valuable team player with strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I am always fascinated by learning new skills.
